Hugo is quite neat! I made this blog using Hugo from [Homebrew on Linux](https://brew.sh), on [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io)!

It took me about an afternoon or so to make it, tried making it as simple as possible, without javascript even :P Theres just some handling for dark mode preferences on CSS directly.

If anything, this is probably one of the most accessible websites you can get since it just uses actually decent HTML tags for stuff instead of using client-side javascript to render everything...

I wonder if I could reimplement something like this in C or something at some point, probably pointless, but would definitely be a fun side project to do

Anyways, here is [my repository!](https://github.com/tulilirockz/tulilog.git)
